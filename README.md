# Devot:ee Monitor

A great free developer tool for use on any size ExpressionEngine site. View what is installed on your site at a glance, and see what add-ons need updating. You can view release notes, and click right over to devot-ee.com to download updated versions.

We'd love to make this one of the most useful add-ons you could install for your ExpressionEngine site. Suggestions and feature requests can either be emailed to <a href="mailto:info@devot-ee.com">info@devot-ee.com</a> or posted as <a href="https://github.com/mdesign/devot-ee-addon/issues">Issues</a> at the Github repo.

This add-on was a joint effort between Masuga Design/devot:ee, eecoder, and Antistatic Design. Many thinks to eecoder's lead coder Aaron Kuzemchak (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/akuzemchak">@akuzemchak</a>) for the initial development, Shawn Maida (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/eecoder">@eecoder</a>) for support and feedback, and Mark Wells of Antistatic Design (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/antistaticdsgn">@antistaticdsgn</a>) for the design and layout. Also thanks to our beta testers for initial feedback and bug reports.

## Note to users

Updated add-on information is pulled from devot:ee every 15 minutes, however, the accessory caches your add-on information locally for 1 hour. You can manually refresh the cache by clicking the "Check now" link in the accessory.
